# DC_using-Pandas

Pandas libraries can be used for Data Cleansing, Data Analysis and Data Transformation.
In this project, we are working on hotel-booking-data.
1) Read hotel-booking-data.txt file using pandas read_table method.
2) Use drop_na() function to drop the Nan values. Don't use inplace=True initially as we need the data present in one column.
3) Use of set_option('display.max.rows', size)
4) Find the number of bookings made by each company?
5) Use isna() fn in dataframe,'where' function in numpy, and 'bfill()' from df to clean the dataset.
